My eyes struggled to stay open as the sea whipped at my face. I lowered my head as did the 
many others around me. Raising my flask to soothe my parched throat, I noticed my hand 
trembling. All of a sudden, an intense rush of fear shot through my body. Gunshots roared 
like thunder in the distance. The burning smell of gunpowder overpowered the sea. Death had 
his grip on all of us, ready to squeeze at a moment's notice. The craft continued forward 
while the soldiers silently contemplated their final moments of life. 

"Godzilla," A japanese scientist whispers. "it returns." 
I tried to dodge, but the shockwave sends me into the sky.
My eyes open again. Tents, with the city's ruins start to render in my mind.
Corpses, ashes, and bricks all overr the place, soldiers march through the streets.

Suddenly, a mournful wind blew through the city. KingKong stood at the top of the Empire State Building. 
It was said that KingKong wanted to battle with Godzilla to decide who is the King of this world.
Soldiers quickly grabbed their guns to shoot towards KingKong. They would never forget the disaster that KingKong brought to the city last time.
